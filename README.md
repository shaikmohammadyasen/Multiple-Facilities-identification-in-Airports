# Advanced Satellite-Based Detection System for Runways, Taxiways, and Aprons Identification in Airports
# Abstract
 This study presents an advanced satellite-based detection system designed for the comprehensive identification of multiple facilities within both commercial and civilian airports. 
 The system utilizes cutting-edge remote sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and categorize various essential elements crucial for airport operations.
 These elements include runways, taxiways, Aprons. Leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery, the system aims to enhance airport infrastructure management, optimize safetyprotocols, and improve overall operational efficiency on a global scale. 
 Leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically object detection models, we explore the suitability of different architectures such as Faster R-CNN,YOLO V8, detectors for accurately identifying these facilities. 
 The project involves comprehensive data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure robust performance. Considering the potential deployment on edge devices, the chosen models are optimized for efficiency without compromising accuracy.

# Detection Head
 The detection head in YOLOv8 is responsible for predicting bounding boxes, objectless scores, and class probabilities based on the features extracted by the backbone network.
 Hereâ€™s how the data for the detection head is derived from the backbone network:
 # Bounding Box Prediction: 
 The detection head predicts bounding boxes around objects of interest. These bounding boxes are represented by four values: (x, y, width, height), whichdefine the position and size of the box relative to the image dimensions. These predictions aretypically obtained through a set of convolutional layers specifically designed for bounding box regression. Each convolutional layer refines the coordinates and dimensions of the boundingboxes based on the features extracted by the backbone network.
 # Objectless Score: 
 Along with bounding boxes, the detection head predicts an objectless
 score for each bounding box. This score indicates the likelihood that the box contains a
 meaningful object rather than background clutter or noise. The objectless score is typically
 produced by a sigmoid activation function applied to the output of a convolutional layer. It
 represents the probability that an object is present within the corresponding bounding box.
 # Class Prediction: 
 In addition to bounding boxes and objectless scores, the detection head
 predicts the probability distribution over predefined classes for each detected object. This
 class prediction is achieved through a softmax activation function applied to the output of
 another set of convolutional layers. These layers produce a vector of class scores, with each
 element representing the probability of the object belonging to a specific class. The number
 of elements in the class score vector corresponds to the number of classes in the dataset (e.g.,
 person, car, dog).
